# Cryptocurrency Grows up

Today, crypto isn’t just a means of exchange—it’s also an investable asset. There have been some growing pains along the way, but farsighted investors increasingly see crypto as a hedge against financial destabilization, a bet on the future of digital transformation, or both. To help you learn more, we partnered with Bloomberg to publish the [third in a series of four FAQs](https://sponsored.bloomberg.com/news/sponsors/features/galaxy-fund-management/cryptocurrency-grows-up/?adv=31474&prx_t=nkYGABKJIAYikPA) exploring the role of cryptocurrencies in a modern portfolio.

# Taking a long-term view on Bitcoin

Bitcoin has had an incredible year—it’s up 172% YTD and just hit an all-time high—leaving some investors wondering if they missed their entry opportunity. While you might be tempted to wait for a pull-back, it's important to keep in mind that bitcoin is a long-term investment.

Our investors typically plan to hold bitcoin for at least three to five years, which means that the "perfect" entry point is far less important than gaining exposure to an asset with lots of room to run. Remember, even at today's price, bitcoin's market cap represents less than 3% of gold's. That's why analysts at J.P. Morgan say that bitcoin could see a "doubling or tripling" in value if the current trend of Millennials preferring it as a "digital gold" continue.* 

If you haven't already, take some time to learn more about Galaxy Bitcoin Funds.
